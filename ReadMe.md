# IO to Graph
The Project converts "%f\n" formatted stdin strings into a visual graph.
The graph does not have digits and the 0 point is centered even if no negative number is given.
You can either can keep stdin open or close it properly by typing "end".

This project also includes a sinetest that automatically gets executed with the `make test` command.
Make sure you have sdl2 installed and unpack the Luna Development Components into the directory if the `ldc/` folder doesn't exist/work.

## Disclaimer
The project is optimized for linux so you might have to do some extra work for other Operating Systems.
